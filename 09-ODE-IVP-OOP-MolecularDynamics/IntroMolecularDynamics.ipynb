    "## **A better visualization and analysis: using Paraview**\n",
    "[Paraview](https://www.paraview.org/) is \"the world’s leading open source post-processing visualization engine. It integrates with your existing tools and workflows, allowing you to build visualizations to analyze data quickly. With its open, flexible, and intuitive user interface, you can analyze extremely large datasets interactively in 3D or programmatically using ParaView’s batch processing.\" . Paraview can run on single laptops, or large scale clusters. You can use it to not only visualize but also analyse huge amounts of data. It has a large list of scientific data [readers](https://www.paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/Users_Guide/List_of_readers). Notice that there are more visualization tools, like visit, ovito, pymol, vmd, and so on. At the end it is important that you print your data in a format that can be read by these programs, like text, or better, something like vtk, hdf5, and so on. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we will learn how to perform a very simple visualzation of our md data. We will need to :\n",
    "1. Choose a format to print the data (text or binary? one file with all time steps or many files? which reader will we use? ...)\n",
    "2. Run the simulation and print the data\n",
    "3. Use paraview to load the data, applying some filters to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's do it.\n",
    "### Printing the data in a suitable format\n",
    "To keep this simple, we will add a funtion to print the system data. The filename will be the timestep, padded to , let's say, 8 spaces. And the content, with the for each particle per line, would be\n",
    "```\n",
    "x, y, z, rad, mass, vx, vy, vz, fx, fy, fz\n",
    "```\n",
    "separated by `,` . Create the function and rerun the simulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE**: To avoid filling the hard disc and the folder with a lot of files, it is recommended to print the system info only every some steps, and in a separated folder. We will use a folder called `DISPLAY`. You can just create it in bash and assume its existence in the program, or use `#include <filesystem>`. and its utilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Loading the data into paraview\n",
    "Not that we have a lot of csv files inside the folder, let's use paraview to open them. The path can change, but at the computer room you just run\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "/mnt/scratch/paraview/bin/paraview &\n",
    "```\n",
    "Then:\n",
    "- Load the data, with `open` in the file many. Hit apply.\n",
    "- Since this is a lot of csv files, we need to make them points with attributes. Go to filter and choose the filter `Table to Points`. Select the right settings and press apply.\n",
    "- Now, add a glyph, of sphere type, and as scale use the fild representing the radius.\n",
    "Now you have your system visualized and if you press play, you can see your system in action!\n",
    "\n",
    "In paraview you can start applying filter, ike only printing particles with some specific speed, or adding some seed histogram in the right, or cut the filter in half and only plot the left part, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also perform an intermidiate step and use a python script to read our csv data and transform it into a vtk binary file, using `pyevtk`, and the load it in paraview. En sample script would be \n",
    "```python\n",
