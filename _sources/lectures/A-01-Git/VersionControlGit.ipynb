    "specific revision of a file, we could use\n",

    "which moves you to the master branch.)\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to undo a specific commit, use\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "    git revert <commit>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "In order to remove untracked changes in the current repository, you can\n",
    "use the `git clean command`. **This is not undoable**, the untracked\n",

    "time. They are very handful for experimental testing and development of\n",

    "To select a specific branch, use the command `git checkout <branch>`.\n",
    "Other uses:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "    $ git checkout -b <new-branch>    # create and checkout the new branch\n",
    "    $ git checkout -b <new-branch> <existing-branch>  # creates and checkout but re-base with some existing-branch\n",

    "```bash\n",
    "    $ git branch new-feature\n",
    "    $ git checkout new-feature\n",

    "After you have decided that the work in an experimental branch is good\n",

    "any branch of reference (like the master one). To do so, use\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "    git merge <branch>\n",
    "```\n",
    "This will merge the changes from branch `<branch>` into the the current\n",
