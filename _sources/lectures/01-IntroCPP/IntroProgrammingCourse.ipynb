    "## Why c++ and not just python?\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of 2026, learning C++ is arguably more valuable now than it has been in the last decade, particularly for **Scientific Computing, High-Performance Computing (HPC), and Machine Learning (ML)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "While Python remains the dominant \"frontend\" language for these fields, C++ is the \"engine room.\" Learning it allows you to cross the barrier from being a **user** of tools to a **builder** of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a breakdown of why you should learn C++ this year, grounded in performance, evolution, and career differentiation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The \"Two-Language\" Reality of ML and Scientific Computing\n",
    "In 2026, the industry has solidified into a two-tier structure.\n",
    "*   **Python** is for **exploration, prototyping, and glue code**. It is easy to write but slow to execute (if you are not using libraries like numpy, pandas, polars, and so on).\n",
    "*   **C++** is for **production, infrastructure, and optimization**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why this matters:**\n",
    "Almost every major Python library you use (NumPy, PyTorch, TensorFlow, SciPy) wraps a C++ or C backend.\n",
    "*   **The Differentiator:** If you only know Python, you are limited to the performance of the libraries you download. If you know C++, you can write custom operators, optimize bottlenecks that Python cannot handle, and deploy models to environments where Python is too heavy (like embedded devices, robots, or high-frequency trading servers).\n",
    "*   **Job Market:** Companies hiring for \"ML Engineer\" or \"HPC Engineer\" roles often pay a premium for candidates who can take a Python prototype and rewrite the critical paths in C++ for production.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Unmatched Performance & Control (HPC Context)\n",
    "In Scientific Computing and HPC, \"close enough\" is not good enough. You often need to squeeze every ounce of performance out of the hardware.\n",
    "*   **Deterministic Memory Management:** Unlike Python (which uses a Garbage Collector that pauses your program unpredictably), C++ allows you to control exactly when memory is allocated and freed. In simulations or real-time processing, this determinism is non-negotiable.\n",
    "*   **Hardware Access:** C++ gives you direct control over hardware resources, including SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) instructions and GPU compute kernels (CUDA is C++ based).\n",
    "*   **Energy Efficiency:** As data centers face power constraints, \"Green Computing\" is becoming a priority. C++ programs generally consume significantly less energy than equivalent Python programs because they waste fewer CPU cycles.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Evolution: C++ is \"Modernizing\"\n",
    "If you heard C++ is \"scary\" or \"messy\" years ago or on the internet, you should look again. The language has evolved massively with the **C++20** and **C++23** standards, making it more approachable for scientific work.\n",
    "*   **C++20 Modules:** This fixes the archaic header file system, speeding up compilation and making code organization more like Python’s `import`.\n",
    "*   **Ranges (C++20):** Allows you to compose algorithms in a readable, functional style (similar to Python’s lists or Linq) without sacrificing speed.\n",
    "*   **`std::span` & `std::mdspan` (C++23):** These are game-changers for scientific computing. They provide a safe, standardized way to handle multi-dimensional arrays (like NumPy arrays) without the overhead of copying data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Educational Value: Understanding the \"Inner Workings\"\n",
    "*   **How a Computer Works:** C++ forces you to deal with **pointers, memory addresses, stacks, and heaps**. You learn that \"variables\" are just labeled memory addresses. This demystifies how a CPU actually executes code.\n",
    "*   **Transferable Knowledge:** Once you understand C++, learning other languages is easier because you understand the *abstractions* they use.\n",
    "    *   *Example:* When you learn \"pass by reference\" in Python or Java, it might seem abstract. In C++, you literally see that you are passing a memory address rather than copying a data value.\n",
    "    *   *Example:* You will understand *why* Python is slow (type checking at runtime, indirection) versus *why* C++ is fast (static typing, direct memory access).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary Table: Python vs. C++ in 2026\n",
    "\n",
    "| Feature | Python | C++ |\n",
    "| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n",
    "| **Primary Role** | Prototyping, Data Analysis, Scripts | Production, Infrastructure, Engines |\n",
    "| **Execution** | Interpreted (Slow) | Compiled (Native Metal Speed) |\n",
    "| **Memory** | Automatic (Garbage Collection) | Manual / RAII (Deterministic) |\n",
    "| **HPC Use Case** | orchestrating simulations | *Running* the simulation loops |\n",
    "| **ML Use Case** | Designing/Training models | Inference (Edge/Mobile), Custom Ops |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Verdict\n",
    "There are millions of Data Scientists who know Python. There are far fewer who can debug a segmentation fault in a TensorFlow custom kernel or optimize a simulation to run 100x faster. Mastering C++ signals that you are an **engineer**, not just a scripter. This extends also to computational modelling. "

    "### The main function\n",
    "Good programming is based on splitting a daunting task into several smaller tasks that are isolated from each other and perform one thing well. Therefore, the concept of a *function* is of paramount importance. In c++, a function has a name, a set of arguments (parameters that it receives, like the domain, although the parameter number and type can be any), and a result type (a range) if it returns something. The typical function prototype is\n",
    "```cpp\n",
    "return_type function_name(type1 par1, type2 par2);\n",
    "```\n",
    "As an example, the following is the declaration (how is called, what it receives and what it returns) for a that receives two integers and return their sum\n",
    "```cpp\n",
    "int sum(int a, int b);\n",
    "```\n",
    "and this would be the implementation\n",

    "int sum(int a, int b) {\n",
    "    return a+b;   \n",
    "}\n",

    "For reasons that we will learn later, modularization is very important. \n",
    "\n",
    "There is a very important function, called the `main` function, which is mandatory per program (and only can be per executable) and is the one that talks to the operating system. Usually, it is expected that the main function calls other functions in the program. Some signatures of the main function are \n",
