    "The [Monte Carlo simulation method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method) uses random sampling to perform computational experiments. One , very famous example, is the [Ising model (1920)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ising_model), used to model magnetic materials (among many other applications). Here, each site on a discrete grid has a magnetic moment (or any other quantity) whose orientation (up/down, left/right, or angle) represents that site state, and there is an interaction with close neighbors (In 1D, neighbors left and right, in 2D, left/right/up/down). The interaction model can represent how the system respond to temperature and external magnetic field, or to external information pressure (for social systems) and so on. Here we will focus on the thermal 2D model that presents a phase transition. First, we will need to define some key concepts. The Ising model represents a system in the canonical ensemble (fixed temperature, number of particles and volume), where the samples are distributed according to a very specific distribution which you need to sample efficiently. To do so, you use a Markov-Chain and the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm.  The random process allows to simulate the intrinsic fluctuations when a system is in contact with a heat bath. "
